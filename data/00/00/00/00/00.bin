  |   Jump into Block Quest Maker "BQM" and build your very own dungeon     |
  |   RPG, packed with puzzles, mazes, and traps. Secret doors, falling     |
  |   rocks, hordes of monsters - challenge them all and level up. Slide    |
  |   a box and reveal its secret, or create your own!                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   But wait. Isn't designing a stage difficult?                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   No, not with this maker!                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With simple "construct" and "connect" controls, it's as easy as       |
  |   playing with blocks.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The controls are easy, but the dungeons you create can be as canny    |
  |   and deadly as your imagination allows. Just use your head together    |
  |   with BQM's traps and gimmicks. Puzzles, action, story - which type    |
  |   of dungeon will you make?                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Share your maze's design with players from around the world and       |
  |   challenge them to outwit its creator.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   But do not fret my friend. If creating is not your cup of tea, you    |
  |   can focus only on playing dungeons made by other users.               |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Let's battle players from around the world and their pitfall-filled   |
  |   dungeons. All kinds of mazes are waiting for you. Use items like      |
  |   bombs, arrows, and magic wands to reveal every secret.                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   It's your turn to make a dungeon and embarrass other players. At      |
  |   your disposal is the Dungeon Editor - create an original dungeon      |
  |   and challenge players from around the world. Everything depends on    |
  |   you! Fix the entrance fee and set your eyes on becoming the most      |
  |   popular creator. Grow your riches!                                    |
  |                                                                         |
